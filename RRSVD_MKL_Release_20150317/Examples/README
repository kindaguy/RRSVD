This directory contains the source files to generate two executables, through the command

make clean
make 

The executables are described below. In the Makefile you will find an example of the calling commands for both the programs. Entries:

make exec: executes TEBD_Trials.x
make generateSample: executes buildSample.x

=====================
-TEBD_Trials.x
=====================
This program reads a double precision complex matrix in input from a binary file and produces the standard LAPack SVD and the truncated SVD, RRSVD. The type of the matrix can be changed by modifying the source code.

Input parameters:

+input_file:    a binary file that contains the matrix to decompose. 
                The format of the file is:
                num_rows (4 Bytes integer)
                num_cols (4 Bytes integer)
                num_rows*num_cols double precision complex numbers (16 Bytes), column major format.

+retained:      integer: initial rank of the approximation.

+q:             integer: number of iteration steps to use.

+tolerance:     float: tolerated approximation error (float number: e.g. 1.0, 10., 1e-6)

+SVD:           (boolean: 1/yes, 0/no) do the standard SVD (MKL_SVD)

+seed:          (boolean:1/yes, 0/no) "randomly" set the initial seed of the random number generator. By setting this
                to 0 you can reproduce results.

+num_dec:       the number of RRSVD to do. In this way you can generate many RRSVD of the same input matrix to test the satbility yourself.

Output: results are stored in different files

Standard SVD (if required)

+A_SVD_timing:  binary file with one double precision float number (8 bytes): the time required by the MKL SVD.

                num_rows: (4 Bytes integer)
                num_cols: (4 Bytes integer): is 1
                num_rows double precision real numbers (8 Bytes): the singular_values.

+decUA:         binary file: the matrix U
                num_rows: (4 Bytes integer)
                num_cols: (4 Bytes integer)
                num_rows double precision complex numbers (16 Bytes): the matrix U in column-major representation

+decVTA:        binary file: the matrix VT
                num_rows: (4 Bytes integer)
                num_cols: (4 Bytes integer)
                num_rows double precision complex numbers (16 Bytes): the matrix VT in column-major representation

RRSVD: as many output as num_dec 


+RRSVD_timing_#.dat:  binary file with one double precision float numner (8 bytes): the time required by the RRSVD.

                num_rows: (4 Bytes integer)
                num_cols: (4 Bytes integer): is 1
                num_rows double precision real numbers (8 Bytes): the singular_values.

+RRdecU#.dat:        binary file: the matrix U
                num_rows: (4 Bytes integer)
                num_cols: (4 Bytes integer)
                num_rows double precision complex numbers (16 Bytes): the matrix U in column-major representation

+RRdecVT#.dat:       binary file: the matrix VT
                num_rows: (4 Bytes integer)
                num_cols: (4 Bytes integer)

buildSample.x
==============

This program generates a double precision random matrix starting from a set of singular values or with singular values decreasing as 1/x and normalized to unity. 

Input: 

+nrows:     (integer) number of rows

+ncols:     (integer) number of columns

+seed:      (boolean:1/yes, 0/no) "randomly" set the initial seed of the random number generator. By setting this
                to 0 you can reproduce results.

+file_out:  name of the output file

+file_in:   (optional) file containing the singular values:
            Format: binary file
            (4 Bytes integer) num_sv
            num_sv double precision real values (8 Bytes): the singular values.

Output: 

a binary file named as required in input, containing the random matrix having the given singular values. Format: as decU.dat produced by TEBD_Trials.x

matrixU.dat: binary file the randomly generated U matrix. Same format as decU.dat.

matrixV.dat:  binary file the randomly generated V matrix. Same format as decU.dat.
 
You can change the type of the matrices by modifying the source file.
